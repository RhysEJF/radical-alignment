## Core Concepts

### [The Crony Belief Mechanism](./concepts/the-crony-belief-mechanism.md) 🌱
Beliefs that spread through coordinated network amplification rather than truth value, where aligned falsehoods outcompete fragmented truths because coherence enables action while fragmentation produces paralysis.

### [The Freedom-Order Trap](./concepts/the-freedome-order-trap.md) 🌱
The unstable oscillation between chaos (from unrestricted information freedom) and oppression (from centralized information control) created when broadcast technology severed the natural unity that freedom and order had in embodied, face-to-face coordination.

### [The Meeting Where Everyone Already Agrees](./concepts/the-meeting-where-everyone-agrees.md) 🌱
The organizational manifestation of the freedom-order trap where broadcast-style meetings create epistemic corruption by rewarding politically safe beliefs over accurate ones, causing bad strategy to emerge from social incentives rather than stupidity or malice.

### [The Conversation Space](./concepts/the-conversation-space.md) 🌱
The cognitive layer between individual thinking and group consensus that was eliminated by broadcast communication, now restored by LLMs which enable infinite, socially-costless dissent and challenge, allowing ideas to be stress-tested through simulated dialogue before they reach human coordination.
